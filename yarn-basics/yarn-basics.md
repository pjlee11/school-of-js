## Yarn basics 

Some basic yarn commands that are worth knowing! 

### Commands

Install the dependencies of this package: 
`yarn` which is the same as `yarn install`

Add a package to the `dependencies`:
`yarn add ${PACKAGE_NAME}`

Add a package to the `devDependencies`:
`yarn add -D ${PACKAGE_NAME}`

See why a package is installed (including which versions) in node_modules/:
`yarn why ${PACKAGE_NAME}`
